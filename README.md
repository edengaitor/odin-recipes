After completing this project, I've learned how to create a new repository for this project on Github, and move that repository onto my local machine.

I've also learned how to create the boiler template for html, and use html tags to create hyperlinks, images, text, ordered lists and unordered lists in the html documents.

Furthermore, I've learned how to create different folders and files within this project, and also create links that link to different files within this project.

Finally, I've learned how to add my files to the staging area in Git, using the command line, and also commit files of this project before finally pushing the files to Github.
