        <h1>Quinoa Cookies</h1>
        <img src="../images/image.jpg">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I bake with my three-year-old at least once a week. We have tried a plethora of different cookies with different fruits and bases. This one was a hit! My three-year-old and older child both loved these, and I did too! They are super simple to make and sneak fiber, protein, and other nutrients into dessert! I used one cookie sheet for nine cookies, three rows of three fit well.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2/3 cup water</li>
            <li>1/3 cup quinoa</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded coconut</li>
            <li>1 cup rolled oats</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 ripe banana mashed</li>
            <li>1/2 apple sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 peanut butter</li>
            <li>1tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1tsp salt</li>
            <li>1tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>3 cup semisweet chocolate chip</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Bring water and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Place a cover on the saucepan, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the moisture is absorbed completely, 15 to 20 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Mix cooked quinoa, coconut, oats, flour, brown sugar, mashed bananas, applesauce, peanut butter, vanilla, salt, baking soda, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Fold chocolate chips into the quinoa mixture; drop by spoonful onto prepared baking sheets.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Bake in preheated oven until browned around the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow cookies to set up a few minutes before transferring to a cooling rack.</p>
